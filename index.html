            <p class="Text">
                KWHousing is a Kitchener and Waterloo based website created to make finding and subletting apartments 
                easier and more accessible to all users. The user will need to create an account in order to list postings and 
                interact with other users using the chat feature of the website. The user will be greeted with a bot (filters) 
                that will narrow down the search and categorize whether the user is a buyer or seller. Once that occurs it 
                will lead them to their desired destination depending on if they are a buyer or seller there will be different 
                interfaces as such. The site will use google maps API and GPS to find locations in Kitchener and 
                Waterloo based on the user’s needs.

            <p class="Text">
                The KWHousing website is a site in which all housing needs will be fulfilled from finding a sublet to finding your dream apartment. 
                The website will be made free of cost thus there will be an optimal website for users to interact with and use. It will be easy to use 
                and is something that will help many students in need. Once this site is up and running it will make a difficult process easier to deal with. 
                The growth of the website and users depends on reliable users and word of mouth. Once the results of successful leases start to 
                spread there will be an increase of users and thus allows the project team to make new changes as they come along. Creating new features 
                and even adding a membership option for more functionality in the website for users. Research and development will be put into this website 
                to ensure customer satisfaction and growth occurs.

            <p class="Text">
                KWhousing is a website that makes it easier for students and others in a location to share information 
                specific to subletting or lease takeovers. Each user has a profile and can select filters to view appropriate postings. 
                There are multiple filters such as: Range of location, price range, and etc.

        <section id="2.3">
            <h3 class="Sections">2.3 User Characteristics</h3>
            <p class="Text">
                The target audience for KWhousing is students and tenants looking to connect with others in the Waterloo and Kitchener area.
                It also helps tenants to find accommodation in their desired area and in their budget by using a filter option. To use the basic
                functions of the devices on which KWhousing is installed, users must have technical knowledge. Previous experience with a messaging 
                app like Facebook Messenger or Instagram chatting option will help reduce the amount of time it takes to become familiar with it. The user 
                interface is designed to be simple and intuitive so that users can operate and navigate the application with less difficulty.

            <p class="Text">
                It is assumed that the application would be user- friendly. Users would be able to share pictures and videos of their houses along with 
                the list of facilities. 
                Limitation would be that the  application will only be useful for people finding an accommodation in Waterloo and Kitchener area and not 
                for people from Waterloo and Kitchener finding an accommodation elsewhere.  (They can just chat and cannot call which may end up with some 
                miscommunication sometimes).
